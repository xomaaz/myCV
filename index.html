          <h2>Hi.</h2>
          <p>I am a Computer Science major at Habib University with a passion for technology and its ability to improve people's lives. Through my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable skills and practical experience in areas such as programming, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. I am also committed to giving back to my community, volunteering with organizations to teach computer skills to underprivileged students. I am particularly interested in exploring the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as I believe they hold immense potential for solving some of the most pressing challenges facing our world today.</p>

            <h3>Physics Simulator</h3>
            <h4>Developed a physics simulation application using C++, Box2D, and SDL2 that accurately simulates real-world physics interactions. The application allows different shape objects to interact in a virtual environment, including setting properties such as mass, friction, and restitution. The project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming and physics modeling</h4>

            <h3>Simon Says</h3>
            <h4>Collaborated with team members to design and develop a Simon Says game using Verilog on the Basys 3 FPGA board. The game utilized a VGA controller to display graphics and sounds, and required players to match a sequence of button presses to progress through levels. The project required a strong understanding of digital circuit design, Verilog programming, and teamwork, as well as the ability to integrate hardware components and software algorithms into a functional system.</h4>
