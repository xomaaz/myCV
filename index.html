        <p> I am a Computer Science major at Habib University with a passion for technology and its ability to improve people's lives. Through my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable skills and practical experience in areas such as programming, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering. I am also committed to giving back to my community, volunteering with organizations to teach computer skills to underprivileged students. I am particularly interested in exploring the areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as I believe they hold immense potential for solving some of the most pressing challenges facing our world today. </p>

                        simulates real-world physics interactions. The application allows different shape objects to interact in a virtual
                        environment, including setting properties such as mass, friction, and restitution. The project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented programming and physics modeling</td>

                        Basys 3 FPGA board. The game utilized a VGA controller to display graphics and sounds, and required players
                        to match a sequence of button presses to progress through levels. The project required a strong understanding of
                        digital circuit design, Verilog programming, and teamwork, as well as the ability to integrate hardware components
                        and software algorithms into a functional system.</td>
